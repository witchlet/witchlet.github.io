        I learned a lot about measuring. I was taking very precise measurements of everything as I was making it,
        which was initially very slow until i realized more efficient methods to measure and mark everything. This was especially
        true for the part I had to redo twice, which also showed me that I cannot slack on the measurements. I think that
        a large format printer, or a projector projecting the placement of the struccture on the ground, would have made the process
        much easier, but my gut was telling me not to use a projector, and I don't think we have a large format printer. I also learned
        a bit more about wood finishes, and different ways to play with light.

        I was really happy with how quickly I made progress, and how I am, in my opinion, noticeably becoming better at fabrication.
        As for what I would change about the project, I would probably use a stronger adhesive to hang the purple laser on the fishing line
        and duct tape more stably. I would also want to try adding more red lasers so that there is blood all over the ground.
        Overall, I am pretty happy with how this project turned out, both conceptually and formally.
