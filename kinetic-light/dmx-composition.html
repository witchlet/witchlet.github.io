       there was never a moment where all four of us could meet up at the same time.
       i thought each of us creating 4 distinct sequences and putting them one after another
       would not end up creating a good composition, because it would feel disjointed and not
       dynamic, due to it being like a stylistic switch up every ~30 seconds, while the structure
       of a song does not typically have parts the exact same in length. i figured that the only
       way to make the disjointedness make sense was to play into it more, and i thought that
       we were supposed to make an infinite composition, so i implemented code so that everyone
       made individual sequences, which were played in a random order. because we couldn't all meet up
       simultaneously, i had to meet up with everyone individually to discuss the project, and 
       nobody mentioned to me that it was not supposed to be an infinite sequence.

       i liked placing the dmx light in the middle of the room, when normally a spotlight would be placed
       somewhere not visible, since the point of a spotlight is to draw someone's attention somewhere else.

       i was thinking about how some music is perceived as "difficult", and harder to get into than other music,
       and i was was thinking about how people only get to the point of listening to avant-garde and difficult
       music after already listening to a lot of not avant-garde and not difficult music. i thought it might
       be interesting to try to make a "difficult" composition of light, where there are sporadic elements
       that you have to sit with before you fully see that it is actually specific sequences playing one after another.
       this also became a really good way to test out all of the different functions and things you can do with the dmx light,
       since playing into the unpredictable, disjointed feeling let me experiment with a variety of
       intentionally highly different settings.

       the generative aspect of the composition was a fun programming challenge, with the random sequence selector
       by far being the most difficult to implement part of the code. part of this was because people have a tendency
       to use delay() in their code instead of using millis() and waiting until they hit certain threshholds.
       this is because delay() blocks the event loop, while millis() doesn't. however, it was interesting how
       star's code, which used delay(), actually ended up as one of the most easily recognizable sequences -- because
       it used delay(), and blocked the event loop, the amount of time it lasted was very consistent.
