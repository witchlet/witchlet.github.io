        <p class="vertical" style="color:rgb(255, 150, 150)">I found both readings about the history of light art to be interesting,
            with the former covering broad developments in the field worldwide, versus the latter covering light art in California.
            Jack Burnham's chapter on "Light as Sculpture Medium" was published in 1969,
            while Robin Clark's "Phenomenal: an Introduction" covered the 1960s and the 1970s.
            What stands out the most when comparing these two articles is how the Light and Space movement focused much more on minimalism,
            pure perception, and complete immateriality than the artists described by Jack Burnham.
            While Burnham emphasizes a "purity of means", which I understand as making visible the techniques and materials, or means,
            used to make art, Clark emphasizes immersive environments and playing with light to make the viewer focus on their own perception
            as opposed to a discrete art object.

            forces the viewer to wait for their perception to change,
            Thomas Wilfred's lumia works, while slow, would give viewers an immediate, accessible aesthetic experience
            of colors being controlled, whether by hand or mechanically. It's also important to note that the first reading has a much more
            negative outlook on the state of light art than the second reading. I think that this can be attributed to the differences
            in technique that phenomenalist light artists were using versus the artists described in the first reading. The emphasis
            on studying, and making known to the audience, the mechanics of human perception, plays into the strengths of light art
            much more than lumia, which could ultimately have similar results achieved with a film projector now
            (and film projectors are popular today, not lumia!). Burnham states that utilizing light in art
            "must be viewed as a further step in the 'ephemeralization' of the art object".
            The phenomenal artists described by Clark do just that.

            Dawna Schuld speaks to this in "Practically Nothing: Light, Space, and the pragmatics of Phenomenology".
            She states that the Light and Space movement, which she calls phenomenal art, is not "informed by phenomenology":
            "it naturalizes it". The minimalism of phenomenal art helps the audience enter the state of "bracketing the experience",
            which refers to understanding experience without the assumption of experience as an objective phenomenon.
            Schuld posits phenomenal art as experiential art. The minimalism of the movement is necessary to make visible
            how perception functions, since there is nothing to focus on besides perception. Furthermore, she claims that the art
            does not only make visible the means of perception, but also that it conditions perception. She gives the example of
            Robert Irwin's "With Fractured Light—Partial Scrim Ceiling—Eye-Level Wire", which, despite visitors "go[ing] in there,
            see[ing] nothing, leav[ing]" made people say "I never noticed how bad the light is in here". It shifted people's attention.

            I don't think I'm personally that interested in making art like this. I think that there's sort of an upper limit to
            investigating perception this way, (especially when constrained by project deadlines and budgets) before it's all kind of
            been done before. What I think is more interesting is being in conversation with phenomenal art and general light art history
            by subverting its standards; by making light not immaterial but material, by using light and drawing attention away from it,
            by being maximalist, by being crude. Martial Raysse satirizes neon art by parodying it in its most commercial forms,
            such as billboards. He also has many paintings that utilize neon tubing as an

            for one element, making his already
            difficult color palettes even more garish. If we view the usage of light through phenomenology, perhaps it makes visible 
            what makes us perceive things as ugly. The neon is

                totally unnatural.
            </a>
            It's ugly, whole works are ugly,
            and the works utilize both the metaphor and form of neon to highlight the ugly consumerism of contemporaneous western society.

            I was especially intrigued by Bruce Nauman's "Manipulating a Fluorescent Tube". In this performance,
            Nauman holds and manipulates a fluorescent tube in various positions, staying still for long amounts of time between changing
            poses, and staying deadpan and silent. The tube is constantly flickering and producing mechanical noise. Perhaps he
            is poking fun at the meditative, bracketed state that phenomenal art causes in a spectator. Another piece of his
            is "Hanged Man", a neon artwork portraying two hanged men, one with x's for eyes, one with eyes that do not imply death,
            and both with their penises visible. The bright neon colors heighten the tension between the children's game of hangman and
            the aspects of eroticism and death, their tacky colors already presenting a tension between colorful children's entertainment
            and adult consumerist iconography. His piece
            <a href="https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/07/books/review/07MOBILIO/07MOBILIO-superJumbo.jpg>">
                100 Live and Die"
            </a>
            consists of 100 neon phrases that state
            "[word] AND DIE" and "[word] AND LIVE". Through this, it outlines various ways people can live or die while commenting on the
            insignificance of our life choices when, ultimately, we live or die. This commentary is achieved through each [word]
            being associated with both life and death. The tacky aesthetics and consumerist connotations of neon signage
            add a realist, down-to-earth feeling to the piece, turning what could be a nihilistic message into an absurdist one.
            Nauman celebrates life in all its color and tackiness and pointlessness, unconcerned with outward appearances.
            Regardless of said appearances, he will live, and he will die.
            So, I suppose this light art is, too, grounded in a sense of otherworldliness.
