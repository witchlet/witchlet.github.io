        Unfortunately, my piece was not completely done by class, but I definitely got useful feedback for the version I presented
        during the show. One piece of feedback I do remember from the in-class presentation is that instead of having all of the stretching
        in one direction with the camshaft, I could have stretched it in several different directions using multiple motors, like
        Catherine's project. I think that would have been nice too. Although, I would probably still want to keep the streetching
        from the top, because the gravity makes it much easier. Maybe one motor per cam for more variations and combinations
        in the stretching would have been good. Additionally, Kaidi mentioned that it would be good to weave the EL wire into the blood
        on the tapestry instead of just having it attaching to the frame, which I had forgotten about. So, I did that by the show, and
        I think it was a marked improvement.

        To be honest, I did not spend that much time with my project during the show. I spent a lot of time by the project "Guardian Geckos"
        by my friends Jessie and Jessy. However, I really enjoyed showing off and explaining my project to my friends who came to the show.
        Also, I loved seeing when people took videos of the piece. If there's anything I wish I had done differently, it's that I could have
        printed out wall text for people to read, so that they could get the full context without needing me to explain it. However, I think
        that the piece manages to speak for itself. Overall, I'm really happy with how the show went and the reception that I got. Also,
        I thought that it was pretty cool to have my piece by the entrance, both as an introduction to and a separation from the other pieces.
        I think the level of light that it was presented in was the perfect amount to make the light visible while still keeping it with a
        sort of weak look.
