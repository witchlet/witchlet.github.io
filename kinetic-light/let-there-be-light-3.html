        My original concept was to make a wireframe sculpture of two hands holding each other using lasers reflected
        by mirrors at specific angles to create the form, and it was going to be called "...so I don't lose you in the crowd".
        However, that would have defeinitely been too difficult, so I decided to make an altar-like structure of pillars 
        with lasers reflected to make a ring of light at the top of the structure.

        At first, the process was pretty easy, and I was making very good progress. I started off by cutting the pillars
        using the miter saw, then laser cut the bases for the pillars, as well as the mirrors. I hand-painted a mixture
        of acrylic paint and alcohol onto the bases, so that they would look darker, sort of like a wood stain. I then
        attached the pillars to the bases, and painted the pillars. It was easier to paint them when I knew they wouldn't
        fall over. Then, I moved everything to the third floor, and positioned the pillars into two overlapping circles.
        I had to redo the second circle two times, because I accidentally positioned the second circle's pillars in such
        a way that a pillar from both circles needed to be placed in the same position. That was the part I got stuck on the most.
        Working on the third floor was also pretty difficult, because I was doing precise measurements, and the lights were off.
        Then, I tested out the lasers, and they diffused too much to make a full ring of light on the structure. Thankfully,
        I found this cool effect of pointing lasers into the edge of acrylic mirrors. With the purple light, there was a fan
        that would turn on every time the laser was on, creating a nice motion of the purple light on the floor. To finish the piece,
        I programmed some simple patterns of flashing and fading for the purple light to follow.
