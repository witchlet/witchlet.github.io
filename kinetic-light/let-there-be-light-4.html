        Overall, I think my presentation went well! I'm not sure anyone spoke about my piece other than my classmate Star
        and my professor, Eric Parren, during the presentation itself. But people in the class would tell me that they liked
        how the structure looked while we were all working on our projects. I also showed it to a lot of my friends after class,
        and mostly got positive reception. My best friend Carol really liked it, which is awesome because she is very honest
        and often critical of my work. ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹ She said the vibe I was going for was totally there, and that the only aspects
        of the piece she wasn't sure about were the usage of purple, which I think is just personal preference, and that it wasn't
        obvious/intentional enough whether the fishing line was supposed to be visible or not.

        While I was presenting, I wasn't able to get the purple light in the exact position I wanted it to be in during in-class critique,
        because I was worried about taking too long. That was a mistake; I should have just taken the extra 30 seconds to make it perfect.
        During the in-class critique, both Star and Eric mentioned that one side of the sculpture felt unfinished/unactivated/neglected,
        since there were no lights there. I think the correct position for this purple laser helps with this a lot, and makes it feel much
        more intentional, so that was one failure of my presentation.
