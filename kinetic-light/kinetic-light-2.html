        In Anti-Oedipus, Deleuze and Guattari conceptualize the body as an assemblance of desiring-machines, emphasizing that such machines are “real ones, not figurative ones” (8). They offer a definition of a machine as “a system of interruptions or breaks”, which is to say that machines are processes that manipulate material flows (38). Their analysis of desire departs from Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis in that they reject the idea of secret, coded desires, instead arguing that desire can only be understood in how it actually, materially manifests. Additionally, D&G understand desire as production, not the acquisition of some lack, synthesizing the outputs of other machines. Reality is constituted of desiring-machines in flux.

        D&G even argue that people desire fascism. A contemporary example of this is that Trump was elected as the president of the United States. D&G would argue that the people who voted for him were not simply duped into fascism, with secret, coded desires for something else – they would argue that the desire of the American people has to be understood as how the election manifested, which was that of a majority vote for Trump. The mechanics and appeal of fascism go beyond simply tricking people, and this notion of people being tricked into fascism creates a defense for it e.g. “I was just following orders”. Fascism appeals to desire; Trump promised a solution to high grocery prices. This populism, this promise of solutions to working-class problems, is desired, even in the midst of Trump’s other policies.

        The machine of fascism goes beyond voting for Trump. Existence and everyday desires are part of this machine, as participation in oppressive systems. Through my pursuit of a degree in IMA, as well as the classes I choose to take, I am actively taking steps toward a future in which I probably work a 9-5 to support my music and art; in other words, a future where I am constantly working and trying to commercialize my hobbies. I already overwork myself to the point of detrimental effects on my health. There isn’t some secret, coded desire behind this. The desire to be a successful artist necessitates working like this, until one is successful enough to not have to. I desire my own unhealthy work-life balance. I desire my struggle to maintain my interpersonal relationships.
