    <h1 style="text-align:center" >hit in the back of the head</h1>
    
    <p>
       i was pulling an all nighter and, in my tired frustration, i kept imagining someone bashing my head in repeatedly.
       that was how i got the idea behind my project. i wanted my composition to be more subtle and inspired by drone music
       than music with a more discrete or narrative structure, because i think there's a dry humor in watching someone get hit in
       the head repeatedly, expecting some sort of change, only to see it continue happening. especially when its
       a whole class of people standing around, and in the context of the assignment requirements.
       even as the sculpture dims out and dies, it comes back to life just to continue being hit in the back of the head.
       <br><br>
       in general, i am a fan of exposing the raw material behind how projects are made (purity of means!), even when it makes
       it ugly. i like how the labor is exposed, when so often extra labor is done to hide the fact that labor was done.
       i liked how the light with no diffusion was somewhat visually abrasive, and how with some level of light, it's kind of ugly.
       i also liked how it was beautiful in total darkness. i liked how something can be beautiful and ugly at the same time,
       especially for an art piece (art is often beautiful) that portrays abstracted violence (violence is ugly, but im abstracting it).
       <br><br>
       as i was making it, i noticed a parallel between the repeated bashes and a heartbeat, and how the abstract whatever of it all
       sort of resembled a heart, so i played into that more. i dont think there's necessarily one correct interpretation for the piece.
       i liked the ambiguity of the body part because the experience of any one body part is necessarily a phenomenon understood through
       how our brain perceives it, causing an intervention between the head and other parts of the body.
       <br><br>
       the most fun part of the project was cutting up my led strip light and soldering the segments back together so i could make them
       into a vaguely heart-shaped abstract representation of a head. i needed some practice soldering, and i thought it was a cool
       technique. i also enjoyed putting a mess of yarn throughout the strip light segments. i wanted to create a sense of irony with
       the parallel of how wires and yarn look vs the contrast of soft yarn with the harsh head-bashing of the technological body part.
