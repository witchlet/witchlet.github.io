            It's interesting how the notion of "machine art" is so disparate among art movements in the 20th century.
            For instance, the Italian futurists focused on the symbolic potential of machines in art. Prampolini,
            in "The Aesthetic of the Machine and Mechanical Introspection in Art", argued that the functions of machines
            like repetition and automation should serve more as conceptual groundings for artworks than as physical principles.
            On the other hand, the machine art of Vladimir Tatlin, a Russian Constructivist, takes an approach characterized
            by removing technical materials from industrial contexts and transforming them into art. Tatlin himself did not
            refer to this as machine art, but as Tatlinism; however, the Berlin Dadaists understood this method as machine art.

            Despite the differences in the conceptualization of the machine, Andreas Broekmann identifies five characteristic aspects
            of machine aesthetics until the 1960s: the associative, the symbolic, the formalist, the kinetic, and the automatic.
            The associative aspect refers to "the social and cultural meanings of technology". Interestingly, commonly between
            the Italian Futurists, the Russian Constructivists, and the Berlin Dadaists, technology and machine signified
            a departure from outdated artistic forms and methods. However, the cultural significance of machines in Futurism is moreso
            about the potential of machines to shape culture and society, while in Constructivism, the machine is shaped:
            the Constructivists saw the potential of machines to liberate man from nature and create the possibility of control over
            a world of his own construction. The symbolic aspect is about using technical icons to represent nontechnical things.
            For instance, Duchamp's readymades, although often industrially produced objects, symbolize a questioning or criticism of
            traditional art. The formalist aspect centers on the aesthetic qualities of machines' functional, technical qualities.
            The artist Fernand Léger argued for judging the formalist qualitis and beauty of machine art by its geometry, utility,
            and material clarity of colors and surfaces, alongside machines' visual qualities in general. The kinetic aspect refers to
            physical, mechanical movement in machine art. Jean Tinguely, an artist particularly associated with creating machines
            as artworks, created kinetic machine art to critique modernism. And lastly, the automatic aspect is focused on automatic,
            self-controlled processes performed by machines. Broekmann argues that, informed by Chatonsky's essay 
            "The Solutide of Machines", automatic art makes visible a new, non-anthropocentric ontology.

            Bruno Munari's work exemplifies the kinetic and automatic aspects of machine aesthetics while maintaining
            a playful, experimental approach. His Useless Machines (1930s-death) are delicate, suspended sculptures that
            often move with air currents, embodying Broekmann's kinetic aspect through their reliance on mechanical motion
            while subverting industrial utility. Munari's Concave-Convex (1947), a motorized sculpture of shifting
            geometric forms, engages with the formalist aspect—its clean, abstract shapes invoke the automatic as it
            operates independently. Munari's machines, though seemingly whimsical, critique modernist functionalism
            by embracing purposelessness, aligning with Broekmann's observation that machine art is associative.

            Alexander Calder's mobiles, such as Lobster Trap and Fish Tail (1939) and Red Lily Pads (1956), epitomize
            the kinetic and symbolic aspects of machine aesthetics. His suspended sculptures, driven by air currents
            rather than motors, exemplify Broekmann's kinetic aspect through their reliance on natural forces to generate
            movement. Calder's work also engages the symbolic—his abstract forms evoke organic life (fish, leaves) while
            remaining firmly mechanical in construction, bridging nature and technology. The formalist aspect is evident
            in his precise balance of shapes and weights.

            One thing I find compelling about these artists' works is how they expand the role of machines beyond functional,
            passive objects to active agents in the meaning-making process and aesthetic experience of artworks. The emphasis
            on motion and machinic autonomy frames machines as dynamic, instead of industrial. While both of their works are not,
            like, my favorite artworks ever (but I do like them!), I appreciate them because their influence on contemporary art is so present, with
            mediums such as interactive installations and generative art demonstrating this. I really like how the mobiles' motion
            depend on natural phenomena, instead of solely manmade machinic motion. The utilization of natural phenomena as if they
            are readymades to be collaged and assembled has so much expressive potential to me.
