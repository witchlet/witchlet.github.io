       we originally had the idea of combining organic forms with geometric shapes, 
       which turned into using orbeez to warp light,
       which turned into making an object able to show its shadows on the other side of itself,
       which turned into making a mobius strip with fabric over it,
       which turned into making a lit-up outline of a mobius strip with fabric over it
       <br><br>
       the orbeez ended up looking really ugly, so we ended up not using them D:
       <br><br>
       we used two led strips and soldered them together so they could cover the length of the mobius strip.
       i think it's interesting how only having made the outline of the shape makes the mobius strip sort-of visible,
       but kind of only after you are told that's what it is. i like how there's more to the piece not only conceptually,
       but formally, when its explained. it's like the ghost of a mobius strip.

       i thought of the name "ritual" as a playful commentary on how art students engage with art during in-class critiques,
       sort of just hovering and staring in silence. i also think that the sculpture turned out quite oceanic, and that
       the otherworldly nature of light art lends itself to a ritualistic experience, especially with the slow pulsing
