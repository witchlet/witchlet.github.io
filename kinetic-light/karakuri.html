       initially, we wanted to connect all of the mechanisms together, so that they could be controlled all at once, and so each
       part of the dragon could move, even when only controlled by one person. it ended up too heavy due to the clay.
       that was my first time working with that type of clay, so i wasn't really sure how the material properties would be. i made
       the body of the dragon and the mechanism for it, while cc made the dragon's clay head and the tails' mechanism and luna made the
       head's mechanism and the dragon's clay tail. i was happy with how the body ended up looking, but the heaviness was an issue.
       that's why there's a piece of wood to keep it in place, so the mechanism works.
       <br><br>
       i will never make mechanisms out of paper again
