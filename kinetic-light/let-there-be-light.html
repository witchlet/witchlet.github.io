        This project features 20 wooden pillars, arranged into 2 circles. Mirrors sit at the top of each pillar, pointing inward.
        One circle is larger, and has 12 shorter pillars, while the other circle is smaller, with 8 taller pillars. 5 of the pillars
        have red laser modules pointing into the edge of their mirrors, creating a diffusion effect of the laser on the floor.
        There is a hanging purple laser pointing into the edge of another mirror doing the same thing.

        Most broadly, this project is a critique of the uncritical usage, overabundance, and prominence of technology today.
        This might be shocking for an IMA and computer science double major, but I am pretty strongly anti-ChatGPT.
        I think that it is used in a lot of situations where people could just use their brains, and that this willing dependence
        on such a tool will result, and already has resulted, in the unwilling dependence on such a tool. For instance, genuinely
        anything ChatGPT can code a person can code more quickly if they took the time to learn what they were coding.
        This project is not only about ChatGPT; it's just the best and most pressing example of what I mean.

        By putting the lasers in the altar, I am placing technology in a place that is supposed to be sacred, and that it
        shouldn't be in. The red lasers, by resembling blood spatter, are a cautionary tale of sorts,
        exaggerating the dependence and prominence technology as one's death at the altar setting. The purple laser is supposed
        to be beautiful and a little ugly at the same time, with the duct tape all over its hanging fixture. I aimed to create
        something vaguely enticing and distracting from the blood spatter, hence it changing over time
        while the blood stays still, while also vaguely fantastical and violent, hence the color and the flashing on and off.
        Overall, I wanted to create an energy that sparks cognitive dissonance and reflection on people's usage of technology.
