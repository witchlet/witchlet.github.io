        my project is essentially a toy that affects one's vision.
        it does this by filtering one's sight through transluscently colored acrylic semicircles which you can spin.
        there are two variations of the toy: one with blue and pink acrylic, the other with red and orange acrylic.
        these two variations in conjunction form the "Glasses" project.
        the primarily intended way to use them is by putting each up to one of one's eyes and spinning them,
        but i intentionally designed them to be usable in a variety of ways.
        they don't necessarily need to be used in conjunction, and they don't necessarily need to be put right up to your eyes.

        i was moreso aiming to do a scrappy perceptual pseudo-experiment than communicate a concept in particular.
        and i thought it might be interesting to see what the perceptual effect of something kinda like color-changing 3d glasses would be.
