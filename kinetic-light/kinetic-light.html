        A crochet tapestry of a body being ripped apart is stretched across the width of a metal frame with red yarn.
        The body is white, with pink at parts where it is torn and red lines resembling guts or blood or something,
        against a black background. The tension of the tapestry is loose, with large holes in the yarn that are made even
        largue due to the stretching. EL wire is weaved into the tapestry, lighting up the red lines in short, randomized
        flashing bursts. At the top of the frame sits a wooden "inverse camshaft", which is inverse in that the linear motion
        is created by pulling instead of pushing, that stretches the tapestry upwards. The tapestry is attached to a wooden
        piece inside of each cam which moves up and down in a hollowed out version of the shape of the cam. The pattern of motion
        of the stretching is slow with sudden jerks and variations in speed. Each cam is in the shape of a heart. The right side
        of the camshaft is attached to a DC motor attached to the frame, and the left side is hanging from the ceiling,
        sat inside a loop of red yarn with multiple visible knots. The camshaft has red stains from the yarn. The motor
        generates a constant mechanical whirring, and the rotating of the camshaft creates the sounds of the wooden piece
        in each cam clanking against its cam.

        This piece was initially inspired by my "death drive" towards overworking myself and burning myself out to the point of
        damaging my health, and how despite the unhealthiness of the routine, I must desire it on some level, since I do it to myself.
        This is coupled with a commentary on the increased pace of life caused by technological developments, with the motor
        literally stretching the body thin. However, throughout working on it, I quickly realized that it was about much more than that.
        The aspects of depravity and body horror have always been areas of interest for my work, and they are more fully realized in this
        piece than any of my other works. In general, I mostly like my body, but I still found working on this piece to be a cathartic
        experience that helped me think about it differently. My relationship with my body has been strained by many things, not just
        my work-life balance and sleep schedule, that I was thinking about when I made this piece. As I worked on it, I think that my
        relationship with sex and been seen and touched in a sexual context was more in my head, and I think it subconsciously shows
        in the work with how disgusting and grotesque it is. The title, of course, is already blending these two aspects of the human body,
        the sexual and the technological, together, and I think that also comes through in the slightly BDSM presentation of the tapestry,
        tied up to a metal frame.
