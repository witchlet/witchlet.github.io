        A crochet tapestry of a body being ripped apart is stretched across the width of a metal frame with red yarn.
        The body is white, with pink at parts where it is torn and red lines resembling guts or blood or something,
        against a black background.

        Most broadly, this project is a critique of the uncritical usage, overabundance, and prominence of technology today.
        This might be shocking for an IMA and computer science double major, but I am pretty strongly anti-ChatGPT.
        I think that it is used in a lot of situations where people could just use their brains, and that this willing dependence
        on such a tool will result, and already has resulted, in the unwilling dependence on such a tool. For instance, genuinely
        anything ChatGPT can code a person can code more quickly if they took the time to learn what they were coding.
        This project is not only about ChatGPT; it's just the best and most pressing example of what I mean.

        By putting the lasers in the altar, I am placing technology in a place that is supposed to be sacred, and that it
        shouldn't be in. The red lasers, by resembling blood spatter, are a cautionary tale of sorts,
        exaggerating the dependence and prominence technology as one's death at the altar setting. The purple laser is supposed
        to be beautiful and a little ugly at the same time, with the duct tape all over its hanging fixture. I aimed to create
        something vaguely enticing and distracting from the blood spatter, hence it changing over time
        while the blood stays still, while also vaguely fantastical and violent, hence the color and the flashing on and off.
        Overall, I wanted to create an energy that sparks cognitive dissonance and reflection on people's usage of technology.
