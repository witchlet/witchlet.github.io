        In "Light as Sculpture Medium", Jack Burnham states "It is apparent that flexibility in Light Art—but not quality—
        depends on new technology", and that light art "is a relatively inflexible and fragile medium" (307). Light art
        necessitates the usage of wires and electronics, while are more than likely visible unless the art piece is a
        whole-room installation. I am a firm believer that if one is making light art, with wires and electronics,
        the wires, or some enclosure, need to be treated and justified as a formal element of the piece, instead of
        having them as a consequence of light art that is supposed to be ignored. This does limit the flexibility of
        light as a medium. It was important for me to make the practical aspects of light art fit into the piece.

        Burnham also asserts that light art "must be viewed as a further step in the 'ephemeralization' of art". While
        this is definitely true in many cases, such as the works produced during Light and Space movement,
        the presence of electronics in light art lends itself to making discrete objects. This was the approach I took
        for this piece.
