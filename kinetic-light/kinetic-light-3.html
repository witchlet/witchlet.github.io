        Somehow, basically everything I wanted to do ended up working out! There are some minor differences from my original idea,
        like how I ended up not using EL panel, and how I stretched the tapestry vertically instead of horizontally, but everything
        ended up coming together very smoothly, and things just sort of ended up working out.

        Making the tapestry was the most difficult part, since this was my first real crochet project. My friend Carol had to teach me,
        because even though I technically knew how to crochet, my technique was really bad, and I would not have been able to finish on time
        or make it as good as I did without her help. Yarn is super cheap in China, which is great! The actual process of crocheting the piece
        was slow, but smooth. It was also very rewarding to see it come to life. It took me a long time to get the crochet pattern how
        I wanted it, since I am not very good at illustration. I did a lot of sketches before I made the final one. I even took some time to
        practice gesture drawing throughout the process, since I really wanted to convey the feeling of the body being stretched.
        Dalin helped me fabricate the metal frame by forcing me to decide on a size and cutting the pieces for me. Assembling it together
        was easy. Stretching the tapestry onto the metal frame was fun, because it was the most easy and expressive part of the process,
        since I was just trying to exploit the natural properties of gravity and stretchiness to make it look as grotesque as possible.
        Weaving the EL wire into the tapestry was a very slow process, but I'm very happy with the results. It took a long time because
        I had to weave the entire length of the EL wire into each hole as I was doing it. I also had some difficulties with the inverse
        camshaft, since it is not a usual mechanism, but I was able to get it figured out. To clarify on the previous description, there is
        a wooden piece joined with yarn to the tapestry inside of each cam (each cam is hollow) that moves up and down as the camshaft
        rotates because of gravity and the pressure from hanging the tapestry. I had some issues with the piece getting stuck and the yarn
        getting tangled on the cams, but I was able to figure it out by making the wooden piece as small as possible and by making the 
        yarn as straight as possible.
