        I learned how to crochet! I'm really happy about that. However, on a less surface-level note, I feel like this project
        tied together a lot of loose, disparate threads in my practice, and it feels like one of my most well thought-out, fully-realized
        projects because of that. The fact that it is crocheted, for me, is very important. I was initially drawn to crochet because
        machines are unable to do it. As I continue my IMA degree, I am becoming increasingly disillusioned with high-tech things and
        increasingly interested in handmade work with visible human touch. It's really important to me that my body meaningfully materially
        influences the final outcome. When I crochet, my hand wants to move a certain way, much like how when I laser-cut, the machine
        wants to move a certain way. There is a pattern, a material trace of the maker, on everything they fabricate. It means a lot to me
        that I finally did a crochet project.

        In addition to the themes of labor and technology, there are also the aspects of body horror and depravity. I have done previous
        work with these topics, but I feel like in my past work, I'm only sort of hinting at it, or leaving it as a minor element. Here,
        I feel like I'm taking these things I've only hinted at, and actually fully doing and realizing them. It's very gratifying. And
        the fact that I'm able to do this through a combined lens of technology and sexuality means a lot to me. Especially the latter,
        since I have discussed that way less in my visual art than in my music. Overall, I am very satisfied with both the conceptual
        basis and the execution of this project. In the future, I want to explore these themes further, and hopefully make something
        that doesn't fall apart immediately after the show ends. I also want to push the material practices in this piece even further,
        by, for instance, using EL wire as yarn instead of simply weaving it into the piece after the fact. I think there's a lot of
        room to explore with these materials that I didn't get to touch.
