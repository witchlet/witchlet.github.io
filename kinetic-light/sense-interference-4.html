        my presentation went about as expected. i'm glad that nobody's hair got caught in the ball bearing,
        because that did happen to me while i was playing with it the night before. but it wasn't bad;
        i just had to spin it the opposite direction a little to get my hair out.
        i was expecting the critique i received -- that being that the project should have been wearable as glasses,
        since it would make for a better user experience, but i wish someone had pointed out the irony that the project
        was called "Glasses" while not being glasses, and considered why i might not have wanted to make them glasses.
        i thought that it was pretty fun to watch people use it, sticking the spinny things up to their face.
        i think it made for a slightly vulnerable and funny spectacle for people to see. but, i definitely do think that
        the actual experience of using them would be more fun if they were glasses, so i agree with the critique.
        but, i do think that my decision to not do that made it more fun for others to watch.

        overall, i think the reception to the project was pretty positive, so i am happy with how the presentation went!
        ultimately, i am primarily concerned with the immediate experience of the project,
        and it made me happy to see how curious people were about the project.
