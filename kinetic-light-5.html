        i think that if i continue doing art that plays with perception,
        i should put more thought into critical theory and the art's historical/political/social context.
        because this was my first foray into this type of work, i treated it more like a study.
        that being said, i do think it was a successful study, and i do think that i created a fun little object.
        the main thing i learned from making this is the value of letting myself make a low-stakes,
        small-scale project largely from intuition. a lot of the work i do is large-scale and ambitious,
        even when it's my first time working in the medium. for instance, i recently made an inflatable for the first time,
        and it was 8 ft tall. i think if i did more quick practice projects before working towards the end goal of the inflatable,
        it would have been a much smoother process. i think the biggest fail was the conceptual aspect of the project,
        because, honestly, when i was making it, i was thinking about it more as a toy than an art object.
        i also could have better craftsmanship for future projects -- i was working very quick and dirty and scrappy for this.

        i am happy with the objects that i made, and having made them, i know i can make more complex, interesting works
        in the future that has more of my artistic voice.
