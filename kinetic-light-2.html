        this project is about subverting both one's usual perception, as well as the already subverted perception that glasses offer.
        simply named "Glasses", the only functionality of the project that aligns with typical glasses is that you see through it.
        while typical glasses are made to be convenient and easy to use, secured onto one's nose and ears,
        this project necessitates the usage of one's hands, if not also somebody elses.
        as such, the perceptual experience of "Glasses" is not only one of altered sight: it is also one of altered touch.
        the convenience of glasses makes them unnoticable once used to them,
        but it would be much harder to have that same experience with this project.

        our perceptions, and the technological advancements that enhance them, should be critically examined,
        even though they are easy to take for granted. this project is an attempt at phenomenological reduction.
        by making wearing glasses inconvenient, as well as distorting the colors of what one sees through them,
        i aim to make visible people's preconceived notions of sight, which is so often treated as objective.
        and, yes, the difficult-to-read anti-design of this blog is in a similar vein.
