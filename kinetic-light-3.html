        this project is extremely simple, and was extremely simple to make. i didn't even sketch the design before making it.
        the decision that took the longest was deciding the color scheme.
        each variation consists of a ball bearing, two pieces of laser-cut acrylic, and two screws to keep the acrylic in place.
        i thought i would have to build my own ball bearings, which would have been the hard part,
        but i was told that the shop actually has ball bearings to use.
        so, all i had to was laser cut the acrylic and screw them in place.
        designing the shape to laser cut the acrylic into took, maybe, 2 minutes, so i didn't save the file. so i can't show it.
        i created a semicircle, and then boolean cut a semicircle the size of the ball bearing from the flat side of the semicircle.
        i prototyped with two cardboard pieces at first, and it worked fine, so i did the acrylic next.
        unfortunately, one of the pieces was ever-so-slightly too small, so there's a little nick at the edge of the orange acrylic.
        then, i marked and drilled holes into the acrylic, and screwed them in place.
